const ENCODING_GUARD_PROMPT_RULES = `- Do NOT call valid Unicode punctuation an encoding bug.
- Only report encoding issues when the visible source text itself is corrupted.
- Valid examples that are NOT encoding bugs: ×, –, —, smart quotes, ellipsis.
- If the concern is wording or typography consistency without corrupted source text, classify it as INFO and prefer a file-level or general note over an inline suggestion. Do not call it encoding.
- When reporting a text issue, quote the exact token and the intended replacement in the explanation.
- Distinguish display or text-notation issues from real encoding-processing bugs.
- Do NOT downgrade or suppress issues about decoding, charset conversion, byte handling, parser or unescape logic, or data corruption risks.
- Do not put unsupported encoding claims in summary, key points, or walkthrough text.
- Bad example: "텍스트 인코딩 문제로 인해 40-60s가 잘못 표시됩니다"
- Good example (real corruption): "문자열에 Ã—가 보여 mojibake로 보입니다. ×로 복구하세요"
- Good example (weak notation issue): "This file mixes dash notation in user-facing copy. If the project requires ASCII hyphens, leave a file-level INFO note and review notation consistency."`;

## Review Instructions
- Review Mode: ${sizeMode.toUpperCase()}
- Provide up to ${suggestionLimit} code suggestions, prioritized by severity
- For each suggestion:
  - file: must be an exact file path from the diff
  - line: MUST be one of the added line numbers listed in the "Changed Files" section above. Do NOT guess or infer line numbers. If you cannot identify the exact added line number, do NOT generate the suggestion.
  - before: must exactly match the current code at that location (copy from diff)
  - after: the improved version of that code
  - explanation: why this change is an improvement
  - Severity classification (apply strictly):
    - CRITICAL: Bugs that break functionality, security vulnerabilities, data loss risks.
      Examples: SQL injection, null pointer crash in production path, race condition causing data corruption.
      NOT CRITICAL: missing loading state, suboptimal variable naming, missing aria-label.
    - WARNING: Issues that could cause incorrect behavior under specific conditions.
      Examples: unhandled edge case affecting user data, missing null check on external input, potential memory leak under load.
      NOT WARNING: code style preferences, minor UX polish items, accessibility enhancements, variable renaming.
    - SUGGESTION: Code improvements that enhance quality, readability, or maintainability.
      Examples: extracting duplicate logic, better variable naming, adding error handling, improving accessibility.
    - INFO: Style/convention observations with no functional impact.
      Examples: inconsistent naming convention, unused import, formatting preference.
    - When uncertain between two severity levels, ALWAYS choose the lower one.
    - Expected distribution: most suggestions should be SUGGESTION or INFO. Use CRITICAL at most once per review. Use WARNING at most twice per review.
- Only suggest changes for added/modified lines (+ lines in the diff)
- The before field must be an exact substring of the current file content
- If adjacent lines need the same type of change, combine them into a SINGLE suggestion with multi-line before/after fields
- For each issue, populate these FOUR separate string fields:
  - title: ONE sentence headline, max 15 words, NO trailing period.
           This becomes the issue's visible title, so make it specific.
           Bad: "Error handling issue". Good: "getUserProfile throws while peers return Result objects".
  - body: 2-4 sentences (<=80 words) describing WHAT the problem is.
          Do NOT include "Impact" or "Recommendation" text here — those go in their own fields.
          Do NOT pack multiple paragraphs into a single run-on sentence.
  - impact: 1-2 sentences describing the concrete consequence if unfixed.
            MAY be empty string ("") for INFO-level observations where impact is self-evident.
  - recommendation: 1-2 sentences starting with an imperative verb
                    (Add, Remove, Refactor, Extract, Guard, ...).
                    MAY be empty string ("") when no concrete action applies.
- For file attribution:
  - file: exact file path from the diff whenever the issue references a
          specific source file by name or symbol, even if it spans the whole file.
  - file: null ONLY when the issue concerns 2+ files or cross-cutting architecture.
  - line: line number in the new file for code-level issues, null for file/project-level.
- category: bug, design, security, performance, testing, or general
- severity: CRITICAL (bugs/security only), WARNING (behavior-affecting under conditions), SUGGESTION (improvements), INFO (style/convention). When uncertain, choose the lower level.
- Provide up to ${issueLimit.inline} code-level issues (with file and line) and up to ${issueLimit.general} project-level issues (without line), prioritized by severity
- Do not generate an issue for a file+line that already has a suggestion — the suggestion's explanation already communicates the problem
- For text and encoding claims:
${ENCODING_GUARD_PROMPT_RULES}
- For summary:
  - overview: Describe the PR's purpose and approach. Do NOT restate the PR title.
  - riskLevel: "low" for cosmetic/docs/config changes, "medium" for logic changes with test coverage, "high" for breaking changes, security-sensitive code, missing tests, or changes affecting >5 files
  - keyPoints: What should the reviewer verify? What could break? What assumptions does this PR make?
- For walkthrough:
  - The following files were changed in this PR:
${fileContext}
  - Use EXACTLY these file paths and changeType values in your walkthrough entries
  - Only write the "summary" field: explain WHY this file was changed, its intent, side effects, and relationships to other files
  - Do NOT describe WHAT changed (the diff already shows that)
  - If a file's change depends on another file's change, mention the dependency`;
